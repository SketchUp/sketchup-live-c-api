    # In SketchUp we found that when we upgraded from v140 toolkit, both v141
    # and v142 would yield random runtime crashes when `rb_raise` was called.
    # Not all locations of `rb_raise` would cause this, only some. We were not
    # able to determine a predictable pattern for this.
    # This would only occur with optimisation enabled. It appear the compiler
    # would in some cases get confused by that Ruby long-jumps when it's throws
    # errors. We observed that objects that in source code was declared later
    # than the triggering `rb_raise` would unexpectantly be attempted
    # deallocated. Investigations indicated that enabling /EHc would prevent
    # this from happening as it instructs the compiler that C functions might
    # throw. Ruby doesn't really throw, but the long jump behaved similary.

    # > The exception-handling model that catches synchronous (C++) exceptions
    # > only and tells the compiler to assume that functions declared as
    # > extern "C" may throw an exception.
    #
    # Related, long jump behaviour in C++ standard doesn't guarranty to support
    # C++ object semantics. Microsofts mention this in their documentation and
    # stresses that it's not portable. They also mention the Microsoft spesific
    # way long jump are handled where they explain that the stack will be
    # unwound similar to try/catch.
    #
    # >In Microsoft C++ code on Windows, longjmp uses the same stack-unwinding
    # > semantics as exception-handling code. It is safe to use in the same
    # > places that C++ exceptions can be raised. However, this usage is not
    # > portable

    # Further the documentation describes:
    #
    # > If you decide to use setjmp and longjmp in a C++ program, also include
    # > <setjmp.h> or <setjmpex.h> to assure correct interaction between the
    # > functions and Structured Exception Handling (SEH) or C++ exception
    # > handling.

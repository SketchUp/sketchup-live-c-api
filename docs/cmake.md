# CMake Example Project

*This document is a work in progress*

The CMake example project for using the Live SketchUp C API is made to reasonable simulate a real world project.

It's not intended for beginners, familiarity with C++, compiling, Visual Studio, Xcode and CMake is expected.

The project is liberally commented around key aspects to inform about why things are set up the way they are.

## Requirements

It might be possible to use older versions for some of this, but it has not been tested.

The project has also mainly been tested as a Visual Studio Code project.

* CMake 3.17 or newer
* Visual Studio 2019
* XCode 11 (Clang 11)

## Getting started with VSCode and CMake

Upon opening the project in VSCode the editor will prompt to install any necessary VSCode extensions that might be missing.

Once open, choose your CMake toolkit and build configuration.
